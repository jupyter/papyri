Returns num evenly spaced samples, calculated over the interval [`start`,
stop].The endpoint of the interval can optionally be excluded.

│..  versionchanged 1.16.0::
│
│Non-scalar :None:None:`start` and :None:None:`stop` are now supported.



│..  versionchanged 1.20.0::
│
│Values are rounded towards -inf instead of 0 when an integer dtype is
│specified. The old behavior can still be obtained with np.linspace(start,
stop,
│num).astype(int)
        

 
Parameters
 
    start : array_like
        The starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        The end value of the sequence, unless endpoint is set to False. In that case,
        the sequence consists of all but the last of num + 1 evenly spaced samples, so
        that stop is excluded.  Note that the step size changes when endpoint is False.
    num : int, optional
        Number of samples to generate. Default is 50. Must be non-negative.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, stop is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included. Default is
        True.
    retstep : bool, optional
        If True, return (samples, step), where step is the spacing between samples.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        The type of the output array.  If dtype is not given, the data type is inferred
        from start and stop. The inferred dtype will never be an integer;
        :None:None:`float` is chosen even if the arguments would produce an array of
        integers.
        │..  versionadded 1.9.0::
        │
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start or stop
        are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be along a new axis inserted
        at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

Returns
 
    samples : ndarray
        There are num equally spaced samples in the closed interval [start, stop] or
        the half-open interval [start, stop) (depending on whether endpoint is True or
        False).
    step : float, optional
        Only returned if retstep is True
        Size of spacing between samples.
Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

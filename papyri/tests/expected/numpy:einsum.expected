einsum(subscripts, *operands, out=None, dtype=None, order=None, casting=None,
optimize=None)
## Extended Summary

Using the Einstein summation convention, many common multi-dimensional, linear
algebraic array operations can be represented in a simple fashion. In implicit
mode `einsum` computes these values.

In explicit mode, `einsum` provides further flexibility to compute other array
operations that might not be considered classical Einstein summation
operations, by disabling, or forcing summation over specified subscript labels.


See the notes and examples for clarification.

The Einstein summation convention can be used to compute many
multi-dimensional, linear algebraic array operations. `einsum` provides a
succinct way of representing these.

A non-exhaustive list of these operations, which can be computed by `einsum`,
is shown below along with examples:

  - Trace of an array, numpy.trace.

  - Return a diagonal, numpy.diag.

  - Array axis summations, numpy.sum.

  - Transpositions and permutations, numpy.transpose.

  - Matrix multiplication and dot product, numpy.matmul numpy.dot.

  - Vector inner and outer products, numpy.inner numpy.outer.

  - Broadcasting, element-wise and scalar multiplication, numpy.multiply.

  - Tensor contractions, numpy.tensordot.

  - Chained array operations, in efficient calculation order, numpy.einsum_path
  .

The subscripts string is a comma-separated list of subscript labels, where each
label refers to a dimension of the corresponding operand. Whenever a label is
repeated it is summed, so np.einsum('i,i', a, b) is equivalent to np.inner(a,b)
<numpy.inner>. If a label appears only once, it is not summed, so
np.einsum('i', a) produces a view of a with no changes. A further example
np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b) describes traditional matrix multiplication and is
equivalent to np.matmul(a,b) <numpy.matmul>. Repeated subscript labels in one
operand take the diagonal. For example, np.einsum('ii', a) is equivalent to
np.trace(a) <numpy.trace>.

In implicit mode, the chosen subscripts are important since the axes of the
output are reordered alphabetically.  This means that np.einsum('ij', a)
doesn't affect a 2D array, while np.einsum('ji', a) takes its transpose.
Additionally, np.einsum('ij,jk', a, b) returns a matrix multiplication, while,
np.einsum('ij,jh', a, b) returns the transpose of the multiplication since
subscript 'h' precedes subscript 'i'.

In explicit mode the output can be directly controlled by specifying output
subscript labels.  This requires the identifier '->' as well as the list of
output subscript labels. This feature increases the flexibility of the function
since summing can be disabled or forced when required. The call
np.einsum('i->', a) is like np.sum(a, axis=-1) <numpy.sum>, and
np.einsum('ii->i', a) is like np.diag(a) <numpy.diag>. The difference is that
`einsum` does not allow broadcasting by default. Additionally
np.einsum('ij,jh->ih', a, b) directly specifies the order of the output
subscript labels and therefore returns matrix multiplication, unlike the
example above in implicit mode.

To enable and control broadcasting, use an ellipsis.  Default NumPy-style
broadcasting is done by adding an ellipsis to the left of each term, like
np.einsum('...ii->...i', a). To take the trace along the first and last axes,
you can do np.einsum('i...i', a), or to do a matrix-matrix product with the
left-most indices instead of rightmost, one can do
np.einsum('ij...,jk...->ik...', a, b).

When there is only one operand, no axes are summed, and no output parameter is
provided, a view into the operand is returned instead of a new array.  Thus,
taking the diagonal as np.einsum('ii->i', a) produces a view (changed in
version 1.10.0).

`einsum` also provides an alternative way to provide the subscripts and
operands as einsum(op0, sublist0, op1, sublist1, ..., [sublistout]). If the
output shape is not provided in this format `einsum` will be calculated in
implicit mode, otherwise it will be performed explicitly. The examples below
have corresponding `einsum` calls with the two parameter methods.

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
Views returned from einsum are now writeable whenever the input array is
writeable. For example, np.einsum('ijk...->kji...', a) will now have the same
effect as np.swapaxes(a, 0, 2) <numpy.swapaxes> and np.einsum('ii->i', a) will
return a writeable view of the diagonal of a 2D array.

Added the optimize argument which will optimize the contraction order of an
einsum expression. For a contraction with three or more operands this can
greatly increase the computational efficiency at the cost of a larger memory
footprint during computation.

Typically a 'greedy' algorithm is applied which empirical tests have shown
returns the optimal path in the majority of cases. In some cases 'optimal' will
return the superlative path through a more expensive, exhaustive search. For
iterative calculations it may be advisable to calculate the optimal path once
and reuse that path by supplying it as an argument. An example is given below.


See numpy.einsum_path for more details.

## Parameters

subscripts : str
  Specifies the subscripts for summation as comma separated list of subscript
  labels. An implicit (classical Einstein summation) calculation is performed
  unless the explicit indicator '->' is included as well as subscript labels of
  the precise output form.

operands : list of array_like
  These are the arrays for the operation.

out : ndarray, optional
  If provided, the calculation is done into this array.

dtype : {data-type, None}, optional
  If provided, forces the calculation to use the data type specified. Note that
  you may have to also give a more liberal casting parameter to allow the
  conversions. Default is None.

order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
  Controls the memory layout of the output. 'C' means it should be C
  contiguous. 'F' means it should be Fortran contiguous, 'A' means it should be
  'F' if the inputs are all 'F', 'C' otherwise. 'K' means it should be as close
  to the layout as the inputs as is possible, including arbitrarily permuted
  axes. Default is 'K'.

casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
  Controls what kind of data casting may occur.  Setting this to 'unsafe' is
  not recommended, as it can adversely affect accumulations.

      - 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.

      - 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.

      - 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.

      - 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,     like
      float64 to float32, are allowed.

      - 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

  Default is 'safe'.

optimize : {False, True, 'greedy', 'optimal'}, optional
  Controls if intermediate optimization should occur. No optimization will
  occur if False and True will default to the 'greedy' algorithm. Also accepts
  an explicit contraction list from the np.einsum_path function. See
  np.einsum_path for more details. Defaults to False.

## Returns

output : ndarray
  The calculation based on the Einstein summation convention.
